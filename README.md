# Signalprocessing
Most of the earthquake signals available are presented in terms of acceleration time-series format
However, there are times when we need to get them in velocity-time or displacement-time series format 
for application
This algorithm help to convert acceleration time series data to other two forms, which is essential of seismologist, earthquake engineers, structural engineer and many others
